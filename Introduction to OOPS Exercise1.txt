WeCare insurance company wants to calculate premium of vehicles.
Vehicles are of two types â€“ "Two Wheeler" and "Four Wheeler". Each vehicle is identified by vehicle id, type, cost and premium amount.
Premium amount is 2% of the vehicle cost for two wheeler and 6% of the vehicle cost for four wheeler. Calculate the premium amount and display the vehicle details.

Write a Python program to implement the class chosen with its attributes and methods.

Note:

1. Display appropriate error message, if the vehicle type is invalid

2. Perform case sensitive string comparison
-------------------------------

Code:-


class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id,type, cost):
        self.vehicle_id=vehicle_id
        self.type=type
        self.cost=cost

    def premium_amount(self):
        if self.type=='Two Wheeler':
            premium_amount=(self.cost*2)//100
            print(str(premium_amount))
        elif self.type=='Four Wheeler':
            premium_amount=(self.cost*6)//100
            print(str(premium_amount))
        else:
            print('please enter correct vehicle type')

vehicle_id=str(input('Enter the vehicle id:- '))
type= str(input('Enter the vehicle type:- '))
cost= int(input('Enter the cost of Vehicle:- '))

automobile= Vehicle(vehicle_id, type, cost)
automobile.premium_amount()
