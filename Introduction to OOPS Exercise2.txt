Consider the below scenario of a retail store.

Customer is a class; attributes are customer_name & bill_amount; Methods are purchases() & pays_bill(amount)

 

Implement the Customer class based on the identified class structure and details given below:

    1. Consider all instance variables and methods to be public
    2. Assume that bill_amount is initialized with total bill amount of the customer
    3. Customer is eligible for 5% discount on the bill amount
    4. purchases(): Compute discounted bill amount and pay bill
    5. pays_bill(amount): Display, <customer_name> pays bill amount of Rs. <amount>

Represent few customers, invoke purchases() method and display the details.
--------------------------------------
Code:-



class Customer:
    def __init__(self, customer_name, bill_amount):
            self.bill_amount=bill_amount
            self.customer_name=customer_name

    def purchases(self):
        total_bill= self.bill_amount-(self.bill_amount*5)//100
        return total_bill

    def pays_bill(self, amount):
        print(self.customer_name,'pays bill amount of Rs.',amount)

customer_name=str(input('Customer name:- '))
bill_amount= int(input('Total bill of customer:- '))

customer= Customer(customer_name, bill_amount)
amount=customer.purchases()
customer.pays_bill(amount)
